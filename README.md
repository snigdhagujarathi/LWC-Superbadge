Before you start
Complete all of the prework, including the installation of the unlocked package. Once you click the button, this step will also pre-populate the boat data in your playground.

Before you begin the challenges, review the Lightning Web Components Specialist: Trailhead Challenge Help knowledge article. Also, read the requirements and the scenario entirely. They are presented in a certain order, to simulate a real-life situation, and you have to identify the dependencies between the components. We recommend developing the components in the order that the challenges are checked.

Since Lightning Web Components use a case-sensitive language, make sure you are applying the correct case in your code.
